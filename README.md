# Earthquakes Tracker

## 🌍 Goal of the Project

The goal of the Earthquakes Tracker project is to combine React skills with Google Maps integration, allowing real-time visualization of global earthquake data. It displays earthquake events (magnitude greater than 2) from around the world over the last two days.

## 📖 Description

Earthquakes Tracker is an interactive web app that fetches earthquake data from a RESTful API and displays it on a dynamic Google Map. Each earthquake is represented by a clickable marker. Clicking a marker shows detailed information, including:

- Location
- Magnitude
- Depth
- Date
- Time

The application is fully responsive, providing a smooth user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## 🎯 Outcome

- A real-time, visually map of recent global earthquakes.
- An engaging way for users to explore earthquake data through a map interface.
- Fully functional, clickable markers providing detailed earthquake information.

## 🛠️ Stack

- **JavaScript**
- **React**
- **CSS3**
- **HTML5**
- **Axios**
- **Google Maps API**
- **RESTful APIs**

React Hooks Used:

- `useState`
- `useEffect`
- `useMemo`

## 🌟 Vision

The future vision for Earthquakes Tracker includes adding a feature that allows users to quickly access a list of the **last 10 earthquakes** that occurred worldwide. This will provide even faster and easier access to the most recent seismic events.

Other future ideas:

- Filter earthquakes by region
- Notification alerts for major earthquakes

## 🚧 Project Stage

The project is currently **in progress**. Core features are functional, and improvements and new features are actively being developed. Stay tuned for more updates!
